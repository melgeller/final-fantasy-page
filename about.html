        <p class="abouttxt">
          A giant, hotcake-selling brand that has been attached to quite a few
          games over the past few decades. Some of them are great. Others are
          less great. But they all share certain common traits. They usually
          place you in the war-ravaged shoes of a hero or cast of heroes who has
          to fight against all odds to defeat some sort of powerful enemy. <br> There
          are usually large, sprawling worlds packed with interesting settings
          and lovely music. You can almost always collect items and weapons,
          customize your characters' skills, and play through minigames and
          sidequests as you gradually work your way toward a nasty final boss.
